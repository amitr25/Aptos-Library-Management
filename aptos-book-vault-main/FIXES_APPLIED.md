  - Updated to use latest Aptos SDK syntax
  - Added proper view function implementations
  - Improved error handling
- **Impact**: Contract integration now works properly with fallback to local storage

### 3. **Development Environment**
- **Issue**: Development server wasn't starting due to dependency conflicts
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated package.json dependencies
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
  - Resolved security vulnerabilities
- **Impact**: Development server now runs successfully on http://localhost:8080

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ **Working Features**
- ✅ React application starts successfully
- ✅ Modern UI with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Local storage book management (sample books included)
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality
- ✅ Add/borrow/return books (local storage mode)
- ✅ Petra wallet integration (ready for blockchain mode)
- ✅ Responsive design with dark/light themes
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors

### 🔧 **Ready for Enhancement**
- 🔄 Blockchain mode requires contract deployment
- 🔄 Contract address needs to be updated after deployment
- 🔄 Production deployment setup

## 📋 Next Steps for Full Blockchain Integration

### 1. Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
# Install Aptos CLI
# https://aptos.dev/tools/aptos-cli/install-cli/

# Initialize Aptos account
aptos init

# Deploy the contract
aptos move publish --package-dir ./contracts
```

### 2. Update Contract Address
After deployment, update the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `src/lib/contract.ts`:
```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";
```

### 3. Test Blockchain Integration
- Switch to "Blockchain" mode in the application
- Connect Petra wallet
- Test book borrowing/returning on Aptos devnet
